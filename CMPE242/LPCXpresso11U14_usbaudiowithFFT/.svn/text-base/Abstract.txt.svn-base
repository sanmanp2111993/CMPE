This project demonstrates an USB Audio Device, FFT Processing and 
FFT Result (UART)

The USB Audio Device is recognized by the host PC running
Windows which will load a generic Audio driver and add a
speaker which can be used for sound playback on the PC.

The FFT data was processed each frame and the result was sent back 
to PC via UART.
