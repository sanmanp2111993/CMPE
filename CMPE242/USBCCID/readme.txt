USB CCID class example
======================
This project contains a USB CCID class (smart card) example device that runs on top of a USART interface. There are four major components in this example
1. the USART layer
2  the generic smartcard (ISO7816) layer
3. a card specific layer that drives a ACOS3 smart card from ACS.
4. USB CCID class layer


Hardware
========
The hardware that runs this project includes a LPCXpresso board with a LPC11u14 wired up to a smartcard socket. The smartcard socket can be found here: http://www.bgmicro.com/soc1021.aspx


This is how the smartcard socket is wired to the LPCXpresso board:

smartcard socket	LPCXpresso
----------------	----------
card detect		  	P1.14
goldpad reset		P1.16
goldpad IO		  	P0.19
goldpad clk		  	P0.17
goldpad power		3.3v
goldpad ground		gnd



The main routine initializes the system and then runs the example. There are two versions of this example that can be run, based on the value of USB_CCID defined in usbcfg.h.

If USB_CCID = 1 -> USB CCID test

The timer, USART, and GPIO systems are initialized
The USB driver is initialized
An endless loop is entered where:
	A card insertiion/removal is detected
	USB CCID class commands are acted upon


If USB_CCID = 0 -> Smartcard test

The timer, USART, and GPIO systems are initialized
An endless loop is entered where:
	A card insertiion/removal is detected
	A series of commands are sent to the card and the response is displayed

ÔÅ∂	LED Status- The status of the LED on the LPCXpresso board indicates any one of the following:
o	Continuously blinking: Indicates that a card has not been inserted yet
o	Continuously On: Indicates that a card has been inserted
o	Activity: When a card insertion is detected, the USART activity is indicated by toggling the LED


This project includes semi-hosting support. This is the expected output when USB_CCID = 0:
